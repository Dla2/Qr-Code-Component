### What I learned

I learned that I should break up my work into the elements i want to style differently with my HTML first then later use CSS to style them how I want.


```html
    <h1 class="heading1">Improve your front-end</h1>
    <h1 class="heading2">skills by building projects</h1>
```
```css
.container img {
    width: 90%;
    align-self: center;
    margin: 10px auto;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to continue with CSS flexbox
